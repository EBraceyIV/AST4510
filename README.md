# AST4510
Code from my astrodynamics course. Orbital mechanics, vectors, transfers, ground tracking, and more.

## What's What
### rv2oe and oe2rv
These files are used to convert between the position and velocity of an object in orbit and that object's orbital elements. These get used by just about every assignment, so drop them into the working directory of anything folder to make sure the code works. The same goes for the Kepler propagation files found in a handful of the assignment folders, they're all the same functions but just left in their respective folders. 
### Homework
The meat and potatoes of the course, where a lot of the fundamental concepts were put into code at first and then used to show off different scenarios and phenomena. HW 3 focused on calculating the position and velcoity vectors, along with a few other properties, of objects in orbit. HW 4 move on to propagatiing and visualizng the orbits of objects based on their known properties. HW 5 covered transfers like Hohmann and two-impulse. The quizzes were the challenges, involved and demanding. Quiz 2 involved ground tracking and inferring the purpose of an orbit's design based on that ground tracking. Quiz 3 involved some more ground tracking and determining how changing certain properties of an orbit affect it. Quiz 4 involved visualizing two-N-impulse orbit transfer.
### Disclosure
I wrote this code in early 2019 and is provided "as-is" with no guarantee that it will work the same way that it did back then. There may be a missing file or two, or bugs / inaccuracies in the code provided. Orbit at your own risk.
### Acknowledgement
A big "thank you!" to my professor, Dr. Rao, who provided a lot of the code templates you'll find in this repository that some of my functions and assignments were written from. You ran a tight ship of a course but it was one of the most rewarding I took at UF. Your passion for the material made the long hours in MATLAB a bit more tolerable. :)
